### Create a "Group" in Mendeley Desktop
Add all of your references to this group, then sync to Mendeley Web.

### Link a .bib file in Overleaf to Mendeley
Within your Overleaf project, select "New File" --> "From Mendeley" --> select the Mendeley Group. 
If you haven't previously linked Overleaf with your Mendeley account, you will be prompted to do so before you can select the Group.

### Check the references
You will now have a new .bib file in your left hand pane. Click on the file and you should see an option to refresh. Do this every time you edit your references within Mendeley to ensure changes are synced with Overleaf.

### Editing your references
If you find an error with your references within Overleaf, or want to add more references, DO NOT directly edit the .bib file. Make your changes in Mendeley and then 1) sync Mendeley with Mendeley Web, and 2) refresh your .bib file within Overleaf. 

### To do
1) Work out how to italicise species names automatically
